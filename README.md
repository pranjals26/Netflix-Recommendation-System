## Here’s How Netflix Recommendation System Works
The recommendation system of Netflix shows you movies and TV shows according to your interests. Netflix has a lot of data because of its user base. Its recommendation system predicts a personalised catalogue for you based on factors like:

- your viewing history
- the viewing history of other users with similar tastes and preferences as yours
- genres, category, description, and more information about the content that you watched in the past
- The genre of the content is one of the most valuable factors that helps Netflix recommend more content even to new users. 

#### Content
This dataset contains all the listed movies and TV shows on Netflix as of 2021. The dataset was collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine.

#### Acknowledgements
Firstly, I would like to thank Shivamb as a similar dataset for Netflix content was available. There were two shortcomings with the previously available database. Firstly, it was of the year 2019. Secondly, (which is the more important part), IMDb rating for the movies and TV shows was missing. This is a very important feature, especially when it comes to building recommendation algorithms.

#### Inspiration
This dataset can be used to perform the following:
EDA (exploratory data analysis)
Data visualization
Building a Recommendation Algorithm
and many more…
